# Monster Learn

This python game is used to teach my kids how to do simple multiplications or read numbers.
The game shows a "monster" that moves slowly closer to the player. The player has to solve
simple exercises to move closer to the castle. To win the game the player has to reach the
castle before the "monster" catches him.

Have fun ;-)
